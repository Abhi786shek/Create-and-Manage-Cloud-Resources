Google Cloud Self-Paced Labs

Overview
Google Cloud Shell provides you with gcloud command-line access to computing resources hosted on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell is a Debian-based virtual machine with a persistent 5GB home directory, which makes it easy for you to manage your Google Cloud projects and resources. The Cloud SDK gcloud and other utilities you need come pre-installed in Cloud Shell, which allows you to get up and running quickly.

In this hands-on lab you will learn how to connect to computing resources hosted on the Google Cloud via Cloud Shell with the gcloud command-line.

Students are encouraged to type the commands themselves, which reinforces the core concepts. Many labs will include a code block that contains the required commands. You can easily copy and paste the commands from the code block into the appropriate places during the lab.
